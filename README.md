### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

## Authenticating an IoT device and having it write data to database (while jumping from a LoRa Network to a Wifi Network)

### Writing the data to the database, feeling exposed and unknown! 
- Trying and failing and failing...
Blinky Project 1 or Connecting a Single Channel LoRa Network to a WiFi Network

--- Trying and finding a saving website with esp8266shop! ,but still no authentication :(

A shortend version with Blinky Project 1 & 2 was given as a FreeCodeCamp OKC Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCnqrZda-Wc

### Authentication (feel the warmth)
- (1) experimenting getting a cryptographic co-processor to sign messages: https://github.com/bshambaugh/getCryptoChipWorking7
couple this with (2) .

- (2) converting the data from a sensor into a format that can be signed.

### Trying to get known
Tying that public key to metadata and verifying it.
I'm starting small learning from my senior: https://github.com/digitalcredentials/docs
background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVMzOcXi1JU (this is a redo of a ThunderPlains 2020 talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9v_JSTAkWw&t=15412s )

### Feeling non-commital to a database, or err well much of anything
I'm just like a lil' shrimp so I'm Learning from my elders: https://github.com/mm-adt/vm .
But mostly I am learning about data structures, algorithms, theory of computation, algebra, and [chasing cats](https://github.com/bshambaugh/bshambaugh/blob/main/CategoryTheory_and_FQL.pdf).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
## I started wondering if we could all be friends
I went on a long journey... (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7N2KmGrwFE) 
Here is an earlier, but recent compilation: https://iiw.idcommons.net/5D/_Enterprise_Information_System_for_Peer_Production_(EISPP)_-_Animations/Wireframes_(2015-pre_DID),_payments,_VRM,_LinkedData%E2%80%A6

I got all JavaScripty with D3, Sigma, and the Marmot:

Went to space with turtles, Drupal, LodLive, and the Marmot (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLqvnFRiP24):
